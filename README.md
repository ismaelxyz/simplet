# SimpleT - Translating without complications

## Introduction

This is a monumental improvement of my "Open Translation"* application, sometimes I don't want to open my browser to translate a small text, but at the same time I want different interpretations, listen to the pronunciation and have that data stored locally for later use. SimpleT is the solution to that.

* This repository used to be called "Open Translation".

## Requirements

* [Python 3.10](https://www.python.org/) or later with the packages:
  * [gTTS](https://pypi.org/project/gTTS/).
  * [deep-translator](https://pypi.org/project/deep-translator/).
* [Electron 19.0](https://www.electronjs.org/) or later. For the graphics interface which will soon be available.
