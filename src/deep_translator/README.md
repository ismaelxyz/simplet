# Deep Translator

A flexible free and unlimited rust tool to translate between different languages in a simple way using multiple translators


## Motivation

SimpleT is a useful tool for translation, the backend of this application is written in Python and the GUI in Rust, the communication between the parts is supposed to be fluent, not achieving that... Now this crate decreases the Python homework.
